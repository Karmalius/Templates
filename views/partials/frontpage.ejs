    Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom. The
    show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household,
    which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children Summer and Morty,
    and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a guest. The
    adventures of Rick and Morty take place across an infinite number of
    realities, with the characters travelling to other planets and dimensions
    through portals and Rick's flying car. Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic
    mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school,
    marriage, love, and family.

    He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a
    kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose na√Øve but grounded moral
    compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old
    sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving
    her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their
    adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and
    assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her
    professional role as a horse surgeon.

    She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure
    person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Different
    versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's
    multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to
    another. The show's original Rick identifies himself as "Rick Sanchez of
    Earth Dimension C-137", in reference to his original universe, but this does
    not necessarily apply to every other member of the Smith household.
